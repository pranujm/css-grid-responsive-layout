1. Set up a 3-column grid.

2. The middle column will hold the content; the left and right columns will be empty.

3. When using grid-template-areas, we can add empty rows or columns with one or more dots.

4. Remember to use the "gap" property to add space between content.

5. To add an em of space above and below the content, we can use empty rows. We don't need to declare the rows explicitly, as they will have a height of "auto". "auto" means they will take up only the space they need, which is effectively none. However, an em of space will be added between the empty row and the content because of the "gap" property.
